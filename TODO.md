- autofill skeleton notes after editing
    - auto-alias target and native
    - add missing sibling/parent stuff
- what to do with overlaps, such as "I create 'buy' as a sibling of 'spend' and later its in the frequency list but with as 'buying' or some shit"
    - maybe after all ad in all the words, but only make some todos
    - or just deal with rectifying it, it's all language work after all...
